                <p>I am happy to announce that ZPPS School is an accredited Cambridge International Centre. We completely follow the Cambridge Curriculum from Foundation to IGCSE classes. We believe that education should be about developing a real thirst for learning. ZPPSS has a long standing reputation for doing its very best for each individual student, by underpinning an exciting and ambitious academic program and a wide range of extra-curricular activities. Words, pictures and the school ecosystem speak volumes about the learning air that flows in ZPPS School. Our school offers outstanding academic, sporting and extracurricular opportunities. Come and see the learners at work and play, really enjoying their time. Speak to them of their success and failures and the lessons these have taught them. Hear about the way children are cared for and nurtured. This is the essence of Zomba Private Primary and Secondary School and it sets us apart from other schools. This is a place where children learn how to treat others the way they themselves would like to be treated, where they learn to grow into well-mannered and balanced young men and women, where they learn to both work and play with a smile on their face. Zomba Private Primary and Secondary is inclusive in the way that we cater for and accommodate children with diverse interests, abilities and talents, while being exclusive in our provision for those who really want to excel either academically, on the sports pitches, drama, art, computing or wherever their strengths may lie. Above all, we strive for every one of our learners to be happy. Happy children, who want to come to school, will eventually find something to latch on to and throw their energies into. Happy children will always thrive and succeed at ZPPS School.</p>
