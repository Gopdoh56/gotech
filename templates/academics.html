                <p>The ending of this term marks the beginning of primary education to our nursery students who have learnt all the basics of learning in speech, writing, letters, basic numbers, knowing colours and importantly introducing themselves to any audience they are required to do so. These are but some basics which we have infused in the early learning of the foundation class. To evoke the interest of learning, our Foundation classes have been involved in extra-curricular activities which made a lot of significance in their long journey of education.</p>
